# Documentation

> #### *Documentation for working with and developing systems as well as tools used for system development.*

Please note that these articles are in a draft state and are being written on a separate branch. Feel free to have a look and send any feedback or pull requests. I'd love help writing them

These articles and guides will form the outline for the rewrite of the book *How to be a Hacker, not a Script Kiddie*. In the meantime, I hope these prove useful to someone... :)
