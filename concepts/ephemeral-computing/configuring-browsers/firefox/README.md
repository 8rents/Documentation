> ***How to keep your Firefox browser in sync from session to session for the Ephemeral Computing workflow.***

---

To configure Firefox for the Ephemeral Computing workflow, you will need to use two primary features.

1. **`about:profiles`** to save and load your browser profile. Signing in to firefox.com doesn't cover all the features that manually managing your profile does.
2. **Signing into firefox.com** while you'll be keeping your profile data intact with manual profile management, signing in will create a handy backup of things like your bookmarks, which should anything happen to your profile would be a disastrous loss.

## Extensions

Managing your Firefox profile through **`about:profiles`** will keep all of your extension data intact from session to session. 

Please refer to the list found in the [Extensions documentation file](../extensions.md)
