# Browser Extensions

> ***This is a work of progress list of the browser extensions that I'm using and have used. These extensions are designed to make the web 1000% better in functionality and appearance.***

## 💯 Completely Essential 😁

These are my 100% essential browser extensions.

1. ### Bitwarden Password Manager

    Bitwarden is a Password Manager. I'll have my passwords saved browser independent. It will provide Autofill Capabilities and simplify sign ins. It will also let me generate long random passwords that I will never see or need to remember.

    **`ctrl + shift + L` to autofill logins is a godsend.**

    - [Homepage](https://bitwarden.com/)
    - [Firefox Add Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/)
    - [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitwarden-free-password-m/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb)              

2. ###  uBlock Origin

    \#1 most essential extension in my book. This provides fine grain control over what the browser loads. Provides adblocking and gets rid of anything I find annoying on the web. Without this the web is broken and unusable. Keep an eye out for a specialized guide on setting up and using this extension.

    - [Homepage](https://ublockorigin.com/)
    - [Firefox Add Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
    - [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en)

3. ### Dark Reader

    **Dark mode** for every website. Take care of your eyes, use dark theme for night and daily browsing. It makes the web so much better to look at.

    - [Homepage](https://darkreader.org/)
    - [Firefox Add Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/)
    - [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh)

4. ### Decentraleyes

    Google and a few other companies host jJavasScript files that help pages work. Since they are all stored on Google's servers google can take note of pages you visit even when you're not signed in. This extension caches each library them on your computer (they are generally tiny files) so that they are loaded faster and Google only sees the first script you download.

    - [Homepage](https://decentraleyes.org/)
    - [Firefox Add Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/)
    - [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/decentraleyes/ldpochfccmkkmhdbclfhpagapcfdljkj?hl=en-US)


## Non-Essential, but Nifty

I'm currently running all of the extensions listed below. However, I don't regard them as completely essential.

1. ### MetaMask

   An Ethereum Wallet in your Browser. Use Ethereum enabled distributed applications, or "Da *DApps"* in your browser! Get with **web3**.

    - [Homepage](https://metamask.io/)
    - [Firefox Add Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ether-metamask/)
    - [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn)

2. ### Enhancer for YouTube

    This extension dials in YouTube to a ridiculous degree. Tons of customizations and tweeaks!

    - [Homepage](https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube)
    - [Firefox Add Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enhancer-for-youtube/)
    - [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enhancer-for-youtube/ponfpcnoihfmfllpaingbgckeeldkhle)

3. ### Simple Translate

    Quickly translate selected or typed text on web pages.

    - [Homepage](https://simple-translate.sienori.com/)
    - [Firefox Add Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simple-translate/)
    - [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-translate/ibplnjkanclpjokhdolnendpplpjiace)

4. ### WikiWand: The Wikipedia Modernizer

    Modernizes Wikipedia pages with a fresh new layout.

    It works by Hijacking all requests to Wikipedia and instead loading the equivalent article from the Wikiwand servers.

5. ### Wiki-m or Wikipedia Mobile

    Automatically loads the mobile version of Wikipedia when ever a page from the site is loaded. **The mobile layout is simply objectively better on every level.**

     When using it with WikiWand, WikiWand offers a menu item to *load page from wikipedia*. When you select this, it will load the page from wikipedia, however it will force a mobile layout page.

6. ### Winscribe

    A free VPN. Really handy to get around local network restrictions. Probably not super great for privacy.

7. ### MD Reader

    A very simple plugin that renders `.md` files as HTML when you open a `.md` file in the browser.


## Firefox Only

The following extensions are available for Firefox only.

1. ### Easy YouTube Video Downloader Express
   
    Download YouTube videos and extract audio from them. Since it's going to take me a while to get back on all my l33t torrent sites, this is what I'll be using to download music in the meantime.

    - [Homepage](https://www.yourvideofile.org/)
    - [Firefox Add Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/easy-youtube-video-download/)
   
2. ### Save WebP as PNG or JPEG
   
    Google's annoying and proprietary `webp` image format is everywhere now. This lets you download those images in a more friendly and cross. This Add On is only available for Firefox. For Google Chrome I use the Extension [Save Image as PNG](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-image-as-png/nkokmeaibnajheohncaamjggkanfbphi)

    - [Homepage](https://github.com/jscher2000/Save-webP-as-extension)
    - [Firefox Add Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/save-webp-as-png-or-jpeg/)

3. ###  Custom Scroll Bars

    Give Firefox a personal touch with customized scrollbars!

    - [Homepage](https://github.com/WesleyBranton/Custom-Scrollbar)
    - [Firefox Add Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-scrollbars/)

4. ### Auto Reader View

    As if dark reader and uBlock didn't simplify web pages enough this extension strips out everything else and just displays pages in a customizable reader view.

    - [Homepage](https://github.com/pmarchwiak/auto-reader-view/)
    - [Firefox Add Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/auto-reader-view/)


## Chrome Only

The following extensions are only available for Google Chrome and Chrome related browsers like Brave.

1. ### Modern Scrollbar

    This is a little bit more sophisticated than Firefox's Custom Scroll Bars. Sadly it sometimes screws up page loads and needs to be disabled. Otherwise it's got extensive functionality and looks great!

    - [Homepage](https://github.com/luandersonn/Modern-scrollbar)
    - [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modern-scrollbar/bgfofngpplpmpijncjegfdgilpgamhdk?hl=en-US)

2. ### Save Image as PNG

   Saves an image (like WebP) as  a PNG. Great counterpart to Firefox's Save WebP as PNG or JPEG.
   
3. ### Always Clear Downloads 2

   Closes the download bar when a download completes and empties the download list when the browser quits. 

    1. I personally don't want the download bar there when the download is complete as when it disappears I know that the download is done.
    2. I don't want a list remaining in the browser of everything I've ever downloaded. Just what I've downloaded this session or is still in the same download directory.

    Great for a minimalist.

4. ### Reader Mode

    Very **similar to Firefox's *Auto Reader View***. The extension will automatically put webpages into Reader view as soon as they load.


## Deprecated *(No longer in use)*

This list of extensions are ones that I have used but given up on or eventually replaced.

1. ### ClearURLs

    Blocks elements from URLs to help protect your privacy when browsing through the Internet.  
  
    Many websites use tracking elements in the URL  to mark your online activity. For example: 

    `https://example.com/printers?utm_source=newsletter1&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sale` 

    All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed.
    
    ClearURLs would strip the above URL down to:

    `https://example.com/printers`

    > **DEPRICATED:** ***Unfortunately I've found that ClearURLs broke several websites, including Firefox sign in. I've had to deprecate it for now. I may attempt to  make a return to it in the future.***

   - [Homepage](https://docs.clearurls.xyz/1.23.0/)
   - [Firefox Add Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/)
   - [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clearurls/lckanjgmijmafbedllaakclkaicjfmnk)

2. ### Emoji Keyboard
   Provides a nicely formatted emoji picker. However you can just use `win + period` or `ctrl + opt + shift + enter` on Mac. Then type what you're looking for. 🤦‍

   - [Homepage](https://emojikeyboard.org/)
   - [Firefox Add Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/emojikeyboard/)
   - [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emoji-keyboard-emojis-for/fbcgkphadgmbalmlklhbdagcicajenei)

3. ### Sidebery (Firefox Only)

    Provides a complex and fine grained sidebar to the browser. Just wasn't user friendly enough. Tabs tree and bookmarks in sidebar with advanced containers configuration.

    - [Homepage](https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery)

4. ### uMatrix

    As an alternative to uBlock Origin, uMatrix provided a couple of extra controls and an interesting interface. For now I'm going to stick with just uBlock.

    - [Homepage](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uMatrix)
    - [Firefox Add Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix/)
    - [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/umatrix/ogfcmafjalglgifnmanfmnieipoejdcf?hl=en)
