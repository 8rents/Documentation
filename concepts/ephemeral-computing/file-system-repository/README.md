## Concept

Do to having **my life's work and all my electronic devices unexpectedly destroyed** in 2020, I set about first figuring out [how to be a software engineer without any digital devices](../../ephemeral-computing/README.md). 

Then after having the next 87 phones and 15 laptops I bought stolen from me, I got tired of redundantly configuring devices. That‚Äôs where the idea for a central cloud stored data repository came in.

I need all of my Users and their Files, Operating Systems and their Software and  Devices and their Backups stored in a logical and easy to deploy way.

I want each new device to be deployed to a usable state with no more than just a few commands.
