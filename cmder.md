Cmder is a very portable terminal emulator that can be installed easily on a USB flash or drive and/or Dropbox and stores all your terminal settings. No more having to run a massive powershell script each time I sign onto a public machine :)



## Download cmdr

- [Github](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.3.19/C)
- ~~[Website](https://cmder.net/)~~ [Down]

## Installation

htps://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases

Scroll down to the assets section of the most recent build and download [cmder.zip](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.3.19/cmder.zip)

## Installation

I'm going to install mine to Dropbox first and put it in: 

```bash
C:\Dropbox\Platforms\Windows\Programs
```

This way each time I download the Dropbox client and get it set up I should have all my terminal settings ready to go.
