## Q&A

### What is a Windows computer with limited privileges?

> - The **computer is shared** by who ever wants to use it and is relatively insecure.
> - The **user account is generic and deleted after usage** and it is not possible to sign in to windows with a personal account.
> - There is **no access to admin** but it is possible to install some portable apps
> - There is **no access to Windows settings**
> - Even **Chrome is restricted and has no access to settings** or bookmarks

### How the hell is this going to work?!?!

> Where there is a will there is a way!

### Wouldn't it be easier to just get your own laptop?!!

> In Theory, **YES!**. But what if it gets stolen *10 seconds after I open the lid*? Or it *blows up just minutes after finishing configuration*? Then what Mr. Smarty Pants? **You're Fucked** and I'm not.

### So you think you're going to be an effective software engineer without owning a computer or a phone?!?!

> **LOL Yep!** Watch me. 👀
