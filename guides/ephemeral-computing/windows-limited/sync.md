## Syncing each Session

This guide will be repeated each time you sign into a limited Windows machine. 

### Syncing with a USB Drive

Having a USB Drive makes things a little bit faster since you won‚Äôt need to wait for Dropbox to download all of your settings files.

### Making a Shortcuts folder (aka Desktop)

After signing in, First open up your USB stick at `D:\\`. I keep shortcuts and links to files that I‚Äôm actively working on in my `D://Desktop` folder. Inside the `Desktop` folder I have a symlink to `Windows 10 Public Library`, which points to `D:\Settings\Devices\Windows 10 Public Library`.

#### File list for `Windows 10 Public Library` Shortcut folder
