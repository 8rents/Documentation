### **[Windows 10 Public & Limited](windows-limited/README.md)**    



I've been left to use the San Francisco Public Library computers to begin developing software again because **any laptop or phone I aquire is stolen in hours.**

These computers have no access to system settings, no ability to sign into Microsoft to sync settings, and they have the bios blocked meaning I can't just fire up a Linux image. 

This is the best I currently have to develop software each day. Just getting a workflow has been a challenge.

*I've cobbled together a dev station using a crude combination of:*

- **Google & Dropbox** - For settings, passwords & files.
- **Typora, vsCode & GitHub** - To write and save files & test code.
- **Cmder & Chocolatey** - To have a terminal, versioning and a package manager.

Since I have no access to admin, I can't just create a VM either to have admin in. It's a catch 22.

I have been able to create an only half way decent development environment to create node apps in.
