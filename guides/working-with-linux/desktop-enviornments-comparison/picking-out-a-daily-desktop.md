## What I'm looking for i a Desktop

I'm coming over from MacOS, so I'm looking for something that's extremely visually appealing. To me, Software should feel good to use and provide a near flawless experience.

At the moment I don't actually have my own hardware and will be starting off using a Live boot USB, so that's a thing. I'm not totally sure how intensive of a desktop I'll be able to run.

While I want the smoothest and nicest looking GUI, I'd like to build my version of Linux from as close to scratch as possible starting off with a bare Debian install.

## The three I'm going to try first

I took a look at a couple of guides [comparing different desktops](https://fossbytes.com/best-linux-desktop-environments/). The three that stood out to me were:

1. [KDE Plasma](https://fossbytes.com/best-linux-desktop-environments/#1-1-kde-plasma)
2. [Deepin](https://fossbytes.com/best-linux-desktop-environments/#6-6-deepin)
3. [Pantheon](https://fossbytes.com/best-linux-desktop-environments/#7-7-pantheon)

### KDE Plasma

### Deepin

### Pantheon
