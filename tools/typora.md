Rarely will I ever suggest a non-free application. However in this department Typora is miles above the competition. It's simple, intuitive and makes writing a pleasure.

## A quick word on Documentation

In my book writing good documentation is probably the most important general skill any developer can possess. This is not only to the benefit of others working with the developers creations, but for the developers themselves some time in the future.

In the past we were taught how to cram and memorize information. Now I propose that instead we learn how to document our education in a way that will be clear to us now, us one year in the future and everyone else with no previous understanding.

Memorization is for suckers. Write good documentation.

## Installation Location

Unless you changed it upon install then the default install location should be:

- **Windows:** `~\AppData\Roaming\Typora\` & `~\AppData\Local\Programs\Typora`
- **Mac:** `/Applications/Typora`

## Setting up a shortcut to Typora install location

I personally like to create a shortcut  to the themes directory so I can edit my themes quickly and from a central point. This is done by creating a symlink and placing it in my `Settings/Typora` Directory.

## Exporting Typora Settings

*Still working on this...*

## Themes

Themes are stored within the Typora Install directory.
