## Installing in Portable mode

Since the library computers are locked down and I have no admin access, I'm going to try to install [vscode in portable mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable) on a USB stick that will be copied over to Dropbox (via Unison).

Make sure to [**download the most recent zip version**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) from the downloads page (Apparently it doesn't work for the other versions. Like User or System).

## Wait a second....

Looks like there's a web version. Fuck all that. 

### https://vscode.dev/

That makes things a lot easier.
