#  Cmder

> ***Lovely, portable console emulator package for Windows***

Cmder is a portable terminal emulator that can be installed easily on a USB flash or drive and/or Dropbox and stores all your terminal settings. No more having to run a massive PowerShell script each time I sign onto a public machine :)

## Goals & Setup

I have 4 main goals for my terminal set up. *I want my terminal to be:*

1. As **portable** as possible

2. As **Linuxy** as possible

3. ***Sexy as fuck*** and ***very configurable***

4. **Using package managers**. We will have one for each platform / shell.

   

### Goal 1: Portable

I want to have my terminal installed on my USB or on Dropbox or Google Drive. I‚Äôd like as many of the settings and configurations to be saved between sessions.

### Goal 2: Linuxishy                                           

I‚Äôm not sure that this is actually a word, but if you‚Äôve used terminals on both Windows and Linux, you‚Äôll see a world of difference in how these things work. I want my bash to be as similar to bash on a Linux install with as many of the same programs. Not some cobbled together frankenbash dumb monster.

This led me to [comparing the 2 bundled versions of bash in Cmder, mingw and mysys2](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra#the-difference-between-msys2-and-mingw).

### Goal 3: ***Sexy as fuck*** and ***very configurable***

We will be using the mysys2 version of bash instead of the mingw version. 

I‚Äôll be adding on a front end to bash as well using either [starship](https://starship.rs/) which is a cross shell prompt, that is super easy to configure and theme, or [oh-my-bash](https://ohmybash.nntoan.com/) which is a framework based on `oh-my-zsh` used for theming, extending and writing plugins.

### Goal 4: Package managers

I want to have package managers available for each of the shells that I‚Äôm using so that I can quickly install and update complex sets of software.

- **For Windows: ** We will be using Chocolatey as our package manager.
- **For Mysys2 Bash: ** We will be using `pacman`! Yep, the same package manager that comes bundled with arch Linux come bundled with our precious version of bash.
